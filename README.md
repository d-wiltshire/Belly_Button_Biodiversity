# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview

This challenge involved displaying a dataset using graphs in Plotly that would be responsive to a D3 event listener. The dataset contains information regarding bacterial samples taken from a fictitious group of volunteers. The dataset was to be displayed by volunteer with a drop-down volunteer list; when a user selects a volunteer from the list, three graphs showing information about that volunteer's bacterial navel culture automatically update on the page. This challenge involved using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Plotly, and D3 event listeners.


## Deliverable 1

The first deliverable was to create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.


## Deliverable 2

The second deliverable was to create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

* The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
* The sample_values as the y-axis values.
* The sample_values as the marker size.
* The otu_ids as the marker colors.
* The otu_labels as the hover-text values.


## Deliverable 3

The third deliverable was to create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.


## Deliverable 4

Deliverable 4 involved adding three customizations using Bootstrap and editing the index.html file. The three customizations added were:

* adding an image to the jumbotron
* adding information about what each graph visualizes
* changing the layout of the page
