# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview

This challenge involved displaying a dataset using graphs in Plotly that would be responsive to a D3 event listener. The dataset contains information regarding bacterial samples taken from a fictitious group of volunteers. The dataset was to be displayed by volunteer with a drop-down volunteer list; when a user selects a volunteer from the list, three graphs showing information about that volunteer's bacterial navel culture automatically update on the page. This challenge involved using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Plotly, and D3 event listeners.
